                <p>
                    These are my current pet guinea pigs Nat and Rat! Nat (right) is outgoing
                    but untouchable, she knows what she wants. Rat (left) is timid but loves
                    petting.

                <p>
                    Dougie is my family's dog currently living in New York! After lots
                    of training dougie has become the sweetest little lap dog.

                <h1>Winnie</h1>
                <p>
                    Although Winnie looks like a dog, she was a cat at heart. She
                    was a pretty sleepy dog. She passed in June 2021.

                <h1>Molly</h1>
                <p>
                    Molly (and Hazel) was one of my childhood cats. She was a sweetheart
                    but took time to get to know. They both passed in 2016 at 19 years old.

                <h1>Hazel</h1>
                <p>
                    Hazel was my best friend as a child. She was outgoing and would 
                    sleep in my bed with me, even if it meant sneezing all night.
